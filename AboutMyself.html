												<h3>Why do I want to do this?</h3>
											</header>
											<p>My passion and drive for undertaking adventures and expeditions stems from Scouting that I did in my youth. 
												I don't quite know how I started, but I remember my Mum taking me to the local Scout group in Farsley for the first time when I was 9 
												and enjoyed it and stayed on until I was 18. During that time I ended up partaking in the Duke Of Edinburgh (DofE), completing up to the final Gold
												Award, involving a 4 day expedition. I don't know what it was, but something about travelling from point A to B under your own physical effort and being immersed 
												in the tranquil atmosphere of nature was very appealing to me. You get to experience more of the world by walking across than if you were
												to drive through or fly over it. Hence why, as soon as I saw someone from my university advertising a talk 
												about a trek to Base Camp Everest, I immediately signed up for it in my first year and had the most amazing experience. I wanted to do more like it,
												but equally at the same time, I wanted to goal to strive for. I liked my degree, but continuous assessments and exams turn
												you away from academia. I just had enough really.  So when I was finishing my Master's degree in Physics I went to 
												research about long expedition people did or had done. This was how I ended up stumbling into the race.
												<br> </br>
												For me, I hope this Atlantic Challenge becomes the starting point of something bigger. Just like how there are different routes up a mountain,
												there are different crossings across the world. I am someone who likes to improve myself and enjoys working towards a goal.
												Once I set my mind on something, I have absolute focuse on achieving that objective. When I first started long outings at my rowing club
												it was about doing long hours and the distance was irrelevant. Then I became stronger, more proficient in sculling, which allowed me to go faster.
												Intially in good conditions, it would take me 4 hours to do 34km. Now I can do that distance 55 minutes quicker, even in gusty weather. 
												I had planned on just completing the challenge, but rowing marathon distance every Sunday morning at the club has made me more inclined to race it.
												Instead, if I am able to reach the start line, I will strive to win the race out of the Solo category and aim to complete the race in under 40 days.
												If conditions are good and have achieved mastery over the boat by the race start, I will aim to go even faster.

												<h3>Miscellanous</h3>
											</header>
											<p>After I decided to take part in the 2025 race, I thought I would do some fun minor challenges in 2021/2022.
											   Somehow, I ended up getting the idea to do these things in Scuba gear. My Dad and I had some old stuff that wasn't used anymore,
											   so I thought why not. The great thing is not only does it act like a costume, but it also adds an extra layer of difficulty to the challenges.
											   Specifically, 32 kg of extra weight.
											   <br> </br>
											   The first one was walking to the top of Snowdown via the Llanberis path. I had recently been active hiking that summer and had 
											   been before normally and I knew I could confidently do it. Although waiting in the queue for the trig point at the summit was less 
											   exhilarating inside the clouds.
											   
										       <br>  </br>
											   My favourite one was the Scuba walk across the Blackpool Illuminations wearing the fins (4 miles). It was a load of fun interacting with 
											   the passerby and cars as well wearing glowing lights. It was also a good time to spend with my Grandad who lives nearby.

											   <br>  </br>
											   The hardest one was definitely the Leeds Half Marathon. Especially since I hadn't really ran such distances before. Walked sure, but not running.
											   Granted, it was more of alternating between running and walking since I only needed to complete the distance in the allotted time and not race it.
											   It was great having the crowd cheering you on and some good sweets too. Thankfully, it wasn't scorching hot.
											   <br>  </br>

												I also used these challenges, to raise some money for local charities near the events. 
												It wasn't a huge amount, but I managed to raise a few hundred pounds for each charity, from the collection
												buckets to justgiving page.
